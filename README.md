Quick Cash

Quick cash was a group project for our software engineering course. Our group of 7 people worked to create an app using Android Studio that would sign a user up, let them search and select a job to earn 'quick cash'. 

In this project, my main responsibilities were the Espresso testing and the Unit tests.

At the end of the semester, we had a app that accomplished 2/3 user stories but we learnt how to use Android Studio and how to write tests. We used Test Driven Developement while working on the projects so the tests were the main focus 
once we finished the research.
